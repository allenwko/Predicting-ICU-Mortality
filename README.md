# Predicting ICU Mortality

This project is using the MIMIC-III database (https://mimic.physionet.org/) to predict ICU mortality.

I've loaded in the data following the instructions available on the MIMIC database website. My code assumes a PSQL server has all the data on it, and starts from there.
